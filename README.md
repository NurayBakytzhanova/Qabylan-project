# Qabylan-project
Qabylanis an AI-powered EdTech platform designed to bridge the gap between basic Kazakh vocabulary and professional fluency. Unlike traditional apps, Qabylan uses a unique Adaptive Reading Engine to make authentic culture and complex literature accessible to everyone.

Core Features

Adaptive Reading: Our AI simplifies complex texts (e.g., *Abai’s Way* or business news) into different levels (A1–C1). Users engage with real content immediately without "complexity shock."
Dual-Track Learning:
1. Life & Career: Functional Kazakh for business negotiations, formal applications, and social networking.
2. Exam Mastery: Specialized modules for high-stakes testing, specifically targeting the UNT (ЕНТ) for students and QAZTEST for professionals.


AI Personalization: Upon registration, the AI maps user interests (Tech, Business, Culture) to generate a personalized content feed.

### **Why It Works**

* **Validated Methodology:** Based on the "Resonance Matrix," prioritizing contextual learning and instant error correction.
* **Expert-Backed:** All content and pedagogical paths are verified by professional Kazakh linguists.
* **Targeted Impact:** Focuses on **Reading Literacy**, the most critical skill for passing national certifications and achieving career growth.

**Qabylan** transforms Kazakh from a "school subject" into a modern tool for success, making the language of the Great Steppe accessible, relevant, and essential for the next generation.
